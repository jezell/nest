## What is Nest?
Nest is a collection of tools that make it easier to maintain a fork of Flutter.

There are various reasons that one might fork Flutter:

 * To fix a Flutter bug locally, while you wait for the Flutter team to fix it centrally.
 * To add needed features to Flutter that the Flutter team has chosen not to implement.
 * To port Flutter to a custom embedded system.

Forking Flutter requires constant maintenance:

 * Constantly synchronize with upstream Flutter changes, to stay up to date.
 * Build and deliver custom engine builds.

Nest aims to create and collect various scripts and apps that make it easier to maintain
and distribute Flutter forks.
